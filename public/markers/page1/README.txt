NFT Marker Files Directory
===========================

This folder should contain the NFT marker files generated from your album page image:

- page1.iset
- page1.flev

To generate these files:
1. Use AR.js NFT Marker Creator: https://carnaux.github.io/NFT-Marker-Creator/
2. Upload your album page image (the exact printed image)
3. Download the generated marker files
4. Place them in this directory

Note: These files are required for NFT tracking to work.
